   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>This Korean fried chicken recipe is officially my favorite. I've had every style of fried chicken known to man, so I've always considered myself an expert. No other method I've come across has the same combination of tender, juicy, flavorful chicken and plate-scratching crispiness as this recipe does. It's simply a must-try!</p>

       <li><strong>Step 2</strong> 
        <p>Make marinade: Stir together chicken, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until chicken is coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 4 hours to overnight.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Step 3</strong>
        <p>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 340 degrees F (171 degrees C).</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Step 4</strong>
        <p>While oil is heating, make the batter: Whisk cornstarch, flour, sugar, pepper, and salt together in a large bowl. Gradually whisk in cold water until mixture resembles a smooth batter. Use tongs to remove chicken from marinade to batter; stir to coat chicken completely. Discard marinade.</p>
